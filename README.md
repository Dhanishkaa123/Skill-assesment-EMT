1. Introduction

Modern space exploration missions depend heavily on accurate charge control, signal transmission, and electrostatic protection in extreme environments. Electric Field Intensity (E) — the force experienced per unit positive charge — forms the foundation of all these operations. This report explores the role and real-time applications of electric field intensity in ISRO’s Chandrayaan-3 Mission, where mastery over electric fields ensured precision landing, stable communication, and successful lunar exploration.

2. Background: Chandrayaan-3 Mission, 2023

Agency: Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
Launch Date: July 14, 2023
Landing Site: Shiv Shakti Point, South Pole of the Moon
Objective: Demonstrate safe soft-landing and rover mobility on the lunar surface

Key Technology Systems:

Electrostatic dust and charge sensors on Pragyan rover

High-frequency telemetry antennas for data transmission

Electric thrusters and plasma-based propulsion control

Lander protection circuits against electrostatic discharge (ESD)

Chandrayaan-3 marked India’s entry into the elite group of nations capable of soft-landing on the Moon, achieving this with indigenous technology and precision-engineered systems that relied deeply on the control and understanding of electric field intensity.

𝑉
V is the electric potential.
This relation shows that the electric field is the rate of change of potential with distance — a key concept in designing sensors and voltage control systems used in Chandrayaan-3.
